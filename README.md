# Introduction
We are building a web application using Django within a Docker environment. As we know from the previous assignment Docker allows us to create isolated containers for different parts of the application, making it easier to manage and deploy. So, in this project, we will use Docker Compose to define and run multiple containers for the Django web server and the PostgreSQL database. By managing Docker networking and volumes, we will ensure that the services communicate effectively and data is handled. I suppose, in this assignment we will provide experience with both Docker and Django, giving us practical insight into how these tools work together in web development.

# Objectives
- Set up a fully functional Django application within a Docker environment.
- Explore Docker Compose for managing multiple containers.
- Implement Docker networking for service communication.
- Use Docker volumes to persist data and files.
- Document the entire setup and configuration process with screenshots and explanations.
